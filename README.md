# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Using-JavaScript
This project is a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with X or O. The first to get three in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins. The clean interface makes it easy to play and understand, offering a simple and fun experience.
